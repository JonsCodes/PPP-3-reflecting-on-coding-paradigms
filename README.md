Getting Started

## Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the Functional.py & OOP.py file to see the implemented solutions and reflections.

## Functional Prompt
The challenge here is to implement a function adhering to the functional programming paradigm. The function should flatten and sort an array of integers in ascending order.

## Key Functional Programming Principles Demonstrated
Data Immutability
Pure Functions
Higher-order Functions

## Object Oriented Prompt
In this segment, we assist Watto with organizing his inventory of podracers. The solution is object-oriented and models the podracers as Python classes.

## Key OOP Principles Demonstrated
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism
